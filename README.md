# Young Star Confirmed Exoplanets

## Description

This research project aims to analyze the distribution and characteristics of confirmed exoplanets orbiting young stars. The focus is on host star ages, error margins in these ages, and methods used for detection. We utilize data from the ExoplanetEU and NASA Exoplanet Archive and employ Python for data analysis and visualization.


## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `counting_young_exo_with_error.ipynb` to view the analysis.
2. Run the cells to generate plots and figures, which will be saved in the `figures` folder.
3. Results, such as young star data, will be saved in the `results` folder.
