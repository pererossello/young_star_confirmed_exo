# Young Star Confirmed Exoplanets

## Project Overview

This project is a part of a larger team effort for the course "Introducci칩n a la Computaci칩n" of the Astrophysics Master's program at Universidad de la Laguna. We aim to identify young stars, specifically those less than a certain age, with confirmed transiting exoplanets. Our analysis relies on data from the Exoplanet.eu and NASA Exoplanet Archive databases.

## Description

This repository contains work in progress for an analysis of young stars with confirmed transiting exoplanets. We're focusing on young stars due to their high level of variability, which has significant implications for exoplanet detection and characterization.

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `counting_young_exo_with_error.ipynb` to view the analysis.
2. Run the cells to generate plots and figures, which will be saved in the `figures` folder.
3. Results, such as young star data, will be saved in the `results` folder.

- `utils.py`: Contains various utility functions that assist in data manipulation and calculations.
- `plot_utils.py`: Houses functions specifically designed for plotting and visualization.
